    Project Orion \cite{projorion} proposed using nuclear explosions to accelerate a spacecraft.  Although Project Orion was cancelled for practical reasons,  it successfully demonstrated the theoretical feasibility of propelling spacecraft using pulses of gas impacting a shock-absorbing pusher plate.

    Instead of bombs, we can give the spacecraft momentum pulses by crashing low density balloons into a pusher plate at the back of the rocket fuselage.  We will call this idea balloon pulse propulsion \cite{aim2024}.

\end{figure}

As shown in \autoref{fig:starship_ellipse}, the balloons are launched into an eccentric orbit from a larger spacecraft, such as SpaceX Starship \cite{starship}.   Subsequently, a suborbital rocket launches from Earth and intercepts the path of the balloons just above the atmosphere.    

The suborbital rocket can take off with air breathing jet engines just like an airplane, igniting its rocket engines at high altitudes. Unlike SpaceX’s proposed Earth-to-Earth direct rocket travel \cite{spacex_earth_earth}, this suborbital rocket facilitates intercity travel in a practical manner that integrates seamlessly with today’s commercial aviation infrastructure. If desired, the rocket can be propelled into low Earth orbit instead of traveling to another city.

If the volatiles used to fill the balloons are sourced from lunar shadowed regions, asteroids, or distant low-gravity icy bodies, we can eliminate the need for heavy rockets to launch the balloons from Earth. Utilizing gravity assists and other techniques, these balloons can intercept Earth at extremely high speeds. Their kinetic energy can be harnessed to produce energy on an enormous scale.   This energy can be used in space but it can also be transferred to power human civilization on Earth.

The remainder of this proposal delves into the details of balloon pulse propulsion and addresses open questions. We then explore how materials sourced from the Moon or Ceres can replace the need for the Starship rocket. Following this, we describe methods to generate clean terrestrial electricity from balloon kinetic energy. 

Achieving balloon pulse propulsion requires positioning the balloons with millimeter precision.  Proving this is feasible is a likely first step in validating the concept.    To attract private funding for a demonstration of this precision, we propose launching a rocket filled with thousands of kilogram-sized “meteors” to create a spectacular artificial meteor shower on Earth. This shower could coincide with a special celebration, such as July 4th, and be visible to most Americans. We also outline the requirements and proposed budgets for this initial step.   Note private investor risk in mitigated because the meteor shower will likely be spectacular and enjoyable even if fail to achieve millimeter precision of each object.

\section{Introduction}
Balloon pulse propulsion is inspired by Project Orion \cite{projorion}.   Aside from violating the Outer Space Treaty \cite{outer_space_treaty}, Project Orion produced radioactive fallout, required enormous ship sizes, and was clearly impractical.   However, it did validate the physics of accelerating a spaceship with pulses of gas or plasma against a shock absorbing pusher plate. 




Instead of using nuclear bombs, we can use low density gas balloons impacting the pusher plate at hypervelocities.   Suppose we launch Starship or a similar rocket into a highly elliptical orbit like the one shown in \autoref{fig:starship_ellipse}.   The rocket payload is made of a few thousand balloons.   The balloon gases (likely water vapor) can be frozen solid before deployment for compact storage in the rocket.    Each balloon should trail the next to spread out the impacts over a few minutes near  periapsis.   Separately a suborbital rocket is launched above the atmosphere from Earth.   It intercepts the path of the balloons to accelerate. 

Separating the payload from the main heavy lift rocket has crucial advantages.   The suborbital rocket can be built study with a low propellant mass fraction.   Additionally, the rocket can be designed to takeoff and land at ordinary civilian airports.   Loud, unsafe, polluting heavy lift rockets can be launched from remote locations without precious cargo onboard.   

The advantages increase if balloons can be made from materials in low gravity wells in outer space.   These balloons can be accelerated to very high speeds with gravity assists to propel spacecraft.   Their kinetic energy can also be utilized to power very large clean energy sources both in space and on Earth.  



\section{Balloon Pulse Propulsion Modelling}
\label{sec:pulse_modelling}
Let's built a simplified model of how large a spacecraft a given mass of balloons can accelerate.

Suppose \(v_r\)\,  \(v_b\),  \(m_r\), and \(m_b\) represent balloon and rocket masses and velocities,    \(a\) represents the constant desired rocket acceleration and \(e\) represents how efficient each balloon collision is, where \(e=1\) would be a perfectly elastic collision.   For simplicity, let's assume the efficiency is the same for each balloon and that 1 balloon impacts the pusher plate each second.   Using the equations for elastic collisions shows that 
\begin{equation}
m_b=\frac{-am_r}{e(a - 2v_b + 2v_r)}
\label{eq:balloon_mass}
\end{equation}
We can write a simple script to loop and add the balloon masses until desired velocity is achieved.   If the final suborbital rocket speed is \SI{7.8}{\kilo\metre\per\second}, \(v_b=\SI{11}{\kilo\metre\per\second}\), and \(e=.6\) then the balloons can lift 112 \% of their mass into low Earth orbit.   

The collision efficiency can likely be improved by absorbing more of the light produces when the balloon gas heats up.   Project Orion assumed these collisions are highly efficient because the plasma was opaque to the radiation it produced \cite{orion_reflections}.  Our gas won't be hot enough to benefit from these calculations, but we can design the pusher plate to spray soot.   Since our pulses can be small, they can also potentially be partially contained by a pusher plate designed to reflect light many times though the gas to increase absorption.   The more of this radiation we absorb, the more efficient our pulses can be.  

\section{Suborbital rockets from ordinary airports}\label{sec:suborbital_airports}
SpaceX has proposed direct Earth to Earth transportation with SpaceX Starship \cite{spacex_earth_earth}.   However, in the unlikely event this received regulatory approval, it would require very complex bordering procedures involving boats to offshore platforms.   If we could use regular airports, the concept would be much more viable.    However, most airports don't have the liquid oxygen handling facilities for a rocket engine.

Since our suborbital plane has a low propellant mass fraction, we can spend some weight including air breathing jet engines for takeoff and landing.   The plane takes off with empty oxygen tanks.   Separately, a specialized oxygen airplane tanker takes off from specialized airports that do have liquid oxygen facilities.    The planes rendezvous and the tanker fuels the suborbital rocket's oxygen tank mid-air.   This is similar to military airplane refueling, except we are tanking up on oxygen rather than fuel.   The specialized oxygen handling airports can be in rural areas near major regions.   A tanker taking off in West Virginia could likely rendezvous with an airplane from any airport between Boston and Washington DC within half an hour of takeoff.   

Suborbital planes with heat shielding can reenter the atmosphere for landing.   However, heat shielding adds weight.   Sonic booms from reentry could create regulatory hurdles.   Alternatively, we can use balloon pulse propulsion to decelerate before atmospheric reentry.   Balloons into the retrograde orbit of the suborbital rocket.   Since these retrograde balloons don't need to be launched into a high elliptical orbit, significantly less mass would be required.

\section{Private Aviation Most Likely Initial Market}
SpaceX Starship payload to elliptical orbits like GTO is about 27 tons \cite{spacex_user_guide}.   This implies lifting approximately a 32 ton plane based on our balloon mass analysis in \autoref{sec:pulse_modelling}.   That is fairly small for a commercial airplane, but is comparable to a mid sized private jet.   Also, the Concorde's economic failure suggests passengers are unwilling to pay very high premiums for faster travel \cite{concorde_expensive}.  The wealthiest private jet customers presumably are less price sensitive and care more about saving time.
